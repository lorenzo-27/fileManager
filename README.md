# File Manager CLI Script

This is a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) Python script that provides the following functionalities:

1. Extract all PDF files from a folder recursively.
2. Extract all files of any extension from a folder recursively.
3. Extract all JPG and RAW files from a folder recursively, dividing the files into two different folders.
4. Extract all HEIC and MOV files from a folder recursively, dividing the files into two different folders.
5. Create n numbered folders from 1 to n inside a folder.
6. Sort files in a folder based on the month of creation.

To use the script, it prompts for a source folder and allows you to choose between moving and copying files for operations [1, 2, 3, 4]. For the 5th operation, it prompts for the number of folders and dynamically renames them, adding necessary zeroes to maintain them ordered in any operating system.

## TBD:
- [ ] Enhance the user-friendliness of this readme file by incorporating images and gifs.
- [ ] Enable script functionality from the terminal.
- [ ] Develop a graphical user interface (GUI).
- [ ] Implement additional functionalities, including an HEIC to JPG converter.
